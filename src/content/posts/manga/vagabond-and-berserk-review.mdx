Two of the stories that I always heard about but never really tried until 2022, to be honest I wasn't a fan of starting two mangas that I know that will never have an ending and even after going through them I still have mixed feelings.

They are undoubtly some of the greatest work ever in manga and considered by many the 2 best Seinen stories.

Seinen and Shonen diff : ...

## Vagabond

I started with Vagabond first, I think I didn't expect to love this story this much watching Musashi evolve was quite the experience but my favorite four parts/moments that stayed in my brain are for sure.

First the Kojiro part where I was at first confused to what's going on, like why did we cut away from the main character to follow this random deaf dude ? but holly shit man I love Kojiro, he is actually so special as a rival that I never seen many like him in other fiction, I think Musashi's story is based on real life story if I'm not mistaken so I'm guessing he would probably win vs Kojiro if they fought otherwise the legend of Musashi wouldn't be true but man I would be cheering for Kojiro personally.

Second favorite moment would be Kojiro vs Ittosai, Tiger and Tiger. Absolute peak.

Third would be Musashi vs seventy, another unbelievable moment that I didn't even believe is happening til I saw it to the end.

And finally, Farming Arc; I don't know why but farming arcs unironically brings out the best out of any story. it's just the greatest arc in Vagabond imo, I wish One Piece or Hajime no ippo had a farming arc lmao.

**Rating: 15/20**

## Berserk

After binging Vagabond, I got started with the more famous one. Considered by many to be the greatest manga of all time and I will go out and say it, I did not enjoy it.

I don't care about what many say the overuse of nudity was simply too much and wasn't needed in 90% of the cases, I will never vibe with that.

That huge issue aside Berserk is good, Golden Age is one of the best flashbacks in manga history and Griffith is an insanely well written villain same as Guts but man this story would be so much better if Casca wasn't assaulted every 5 chapters ... Like if it was done only in the Eclipse then I guess but it was so overused.

**Rating: 8/20**

## Both Endings

Ironically tho, I enjoyed Berserk ending way more. At the very least I got 1 out of 2 things I was looking forward to. Both stories had 2 similar things I was looking towards :

- Guts & Casca reunion
- Guts vs Griffith
- Musashi & Otsu reunion
- Musashi vs Kojiro

We only got Guts & Casca reunion really the other 3 we never got to. Vagabond is an insanely missed opportunity, I don't know why Inoue dropped the story but out of all the stories I read out there, Vagabond could've easily been one of the greatest of all time manga/anime especially if it got the adaptation it deserves.
