Some hit hard, some missed the mark completely, and others fell somewhere in the middle. Here's my take on each one, with an eye toward what worked and what didn't.\n\n---\n\n## Black Clover (Episodes 1-170) - **12/20**\n\nBlack Clover starts with an interesting premise but quickly loses steam for me. Like I expected something similar to Fairy Tail or Naruto, something grand and epic and I kinda did get that ... I think all things considered I did like BC but it didn't reach the heights of the other stories that I watched/read by then at least up until Episode 170.\n\nI will be completely honest, one thing that _really_ bothered me was Asta's voice because for some reason I decided to watch it as dubbed and it's an all time worst casting I heard like my eardrumbs could not keep up with the constant screaming. But hey I got through it.\n\nAnother thing that I did not like would be Yuno, I just don't care for that archtype of character ; just too boring and he reminds me of Bleach's uyru (maybe he is not as useless as uryu) but he just felt too bland.\n\nWhile Asta's journey to becoming the Wizard King has its exciting moments, the series is weighed down by a predictable plot. The characters have their charm, and this is probably my favorite thing about Black Clover, I really love the black bulls (maybe not the nose bleeding dude) but it's warming to see such a good team dynamic like One Piece's StrawHats.\n\n---\n\n## Blue Exorcist - **9/20**\n\nBlue Exorcist had the setup for a strong story—a half-demon teen who fights against his heritage while training to be an exorcist. However, the show quickly diverges into repetitive, formulaic arcs, with limited character growth. Despite a few standout battles and Rin's rebellious energy, it felt like a typical supernatural shonen that didn't fully live up to its potential.\n\n---\n\n## Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion - **12/20**\n\n_Code Geass_ is famous for its intense political plots and the high-stakes tactics of Lelouch Lamperouge. His transformation from a scheming anti-hero into a tragic figure is both compelling and twisted, but the plot twists sometimes feel forced. The show is gripping but occasionally too convoluted for its own good. Still, Lelouch is a fascinating character, even if the show's ambition sometimes overrides its clarity.\n\nAlso L/Kira are smarter, I know this was a debate back in the day but the debate is wrong.\n\n---\n\n## Cowboy Bebop - **13/20**\n\nThis iconic series is stylish, atmospheric, and defined by its complex, moody characters and episodic adventures. Spike Spiegel and his ragtag crew deliver an unforgettable space western experience, yet the series' slow pace and loose narrative aren't always for everyone. The strong visuals, music, and philosophical themes left an impression, but as a whole, it didn't captivate me as much as I hoped.\n\nOh also I made the mistake of watching the Live Action, if you are considering it; don't.\n\n---\n\n## Mob Psycho 100 - **16/20**\n\n_Mob Psycho 100_ is a solid, tightly woven story about psychic powers, self-discovery, and the strength found in vulnerability. Watching Mob grow emotionally while contending with immense power made for a powerful character arc, especially with a beautifully wrapped-up ending. The story's uniqueness and heart elevated it to one of the best in the genre, along with standout animation and humor that clicked.\n\nOne of my favorites of all time for sure, I really really loved Mob's character arc and the ending is surprisngly perfect which's hard to do in shows these days.\n\n---\n\n## Monster - **6/20**\n\n_Monster_ is a highly acclaimed psychological thriller, but it didn't resonate with me. While the premise of a doctor-turned-detective chasing a sociopathic killer through Eastern Europe is unique, the story's slow, plodding pace detracted from the suspense. The moral and ethical questions are intriguing, yet the show's length feels unnecessarily stretched, making it difficult to stay engaged.\n\n---\n\n## One Punch Man - **13/20**\n\nOne Punch Man's absurd premise—a hero who defeats all enemies with one punch—blends humor and action, though the novelty of Saitama's overpowered shtick wears thin over time. The characters like Genos add depth to the story, but it's best enjoyed as a humorous parody of the shonen genre rather than for its plot depth. Season 1's animation is legendary, but the thrill lessens with repetition.\n\nOverall it feels like firework comedy but nothing beyond it and it's fine with me. I will probably consider reading the manga since the art is crazy good there.\n\n---\n\n## Spy x Family - **12/20**\n\nSpy x Family's quirky family dynamic and premise had a ton of potential, following an elite spy who must build a “pretend” family to complete his mission. The comedy, action, and relationships are enjoyable, but it struggles with pacing, and the plot sometimes feels more slice-of-life than spy thriller. Anya's innocence and telepathic abilities provide charm, though the overall series didn't have enough high stakes to keep me hooked.\n\nReally looking forward to the next season, it's a great slice of life.\n\n---\n\n## Steins;Gate - **10/20**\n\n_Steins;Gate_ explores time travel and conspiracy theories, and it has an intriguing, mind-bending plot. The protagonist's journey is complex, but the show's slow build-up and convoluted time-loop mechanics made it feel tedious. Although the plot eventually takes off, the confusing structure took away from my enjoyment, leaving it as an interesting, if uneven, viewing experience.\n\n---\n\n## The Promised Neverland - **12/20**\n\nSeason 1 of _The Promised Neverland_ had me completely hooked. The twist was shocking, with genuinely creepy moments and brilliant suspense.\n\nHowever, Season 2 was a huge disappointment. The plot abandoned much of the mystery, cutting corners in a way that felt rushed and unsatisfying. It's a shame, as the first season set up what could have been an outstanding series.\n\n---\n\n## To Your Eternity - **11/20**\n\nThis anime started strong with an emotional, philosophical premise about an immortal entity learning about life, love, and loss.\n\nThe first season was compelling and deeply moving, but the second season lost focus, dragging out the narrative. It's a series with a beautiful premise that got bogged down as it progressed, making it hard to maintain the emotional connection.\n\nAnd it kinda got repetitive/tiring after a while, like everyone dies and the cycle continues :sob: and I honestly don't understand the end game of the creatures that keep popping up.\n\n---\n\n## Tokyo Revengers - **4/20**\n\n_Tokyo Revengers_ is one of the most mid shows I've watched. The time-traveling plot concept is interesting, but the execution is seriously flawed.\n\nWHERE ARE THE PARENTS, that's the only question I had when middle schoolers are acting up like gangs. like what even is going on ... I ended up dropping it after it got more boring in season 2 ... I think the only interesting moment was the end of s1 where the villain or at least the assumed villains apologize to the mc then it ends there.\n\n---\n\n## Ranking of Kings - **7/20**\n\n_Ranking of Kings_ brings a unique, fairy-tale style approach, following a deaf prince with an unbreakable spirit. But it was simply not my cup of tee really so I just dropped it.\n\n---\n\n## Kuroko no Basket - **10/20**\n\nAhh sports anime ... Great concept in theory but fumbled more often than not, Kuroko is one of the few I watched back in the day ... I think it's _fine_, it's neither bad nor great that's why it's in the dead middle at 10 but I will get into this in other reviews where I go into the new Sports anime individually on what they did right or wrong.\n\n_Kuroko no Basket_ is over the top which's what I really dislike cause I would've prefered a more grounded approche to it. But at the end it was okay and that's my take on it.\n\n---\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThese anime series cover a lot of ground, from supernatural adventures to sci-fi thrillers, sports, and slice-of-life. While some were unforgettable, others felt like a letdown, with pacing and plot execution issues that made them hard to stay engaged with. _Mob Psycho_ stood out as a highlight for me, while _Tokyo Revengers_ and _Monster_ were among the biggest disappointments. It's been a fun journey through different genres, and there's always something new to try in the anime world!\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\n# Bleach Review Part 1\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nAfter finishing Naruto in 2015, I was ready for another deep dive into the \"Big 3\" Anime lineup. I'd just powered through the ninja world, so it was time to pick between pirates or samurai — and Bleach won out easily. Going from the Hidden Leaf to Soul Society, I was ready for something raw, mysterious, and packed with action.\n\nToday, I'm following what I'd consider “Part 2,” the **Thousand-Year Blood War** arc, and there's a lot to unpack in this journey so far.\n\n## The Plot\n\nBleach starts strong with a rawness that immediately pulls you in. The Soul Society arc is where Bleach really shines; it's the best of shonen. This arc gave us Aizen, one of the best villains in anime. He's clever, calculated, and commanding. If you could bottle the perfect shonen villain, you'd end up with Aizen. His reveal as the traitor? An all-time moment that sets the bar high for what villains can be.\n\nThe _Hueco Mundo_ arc and the introduction of the Espada kept me hooked. Ulquiorra vs. Ichigo was an insane fight that gave me all the chills. It was the perfect mix of raw power and dark storytelling, showing Ichigo at his peak and how far he could push himself. Plus, _Bankai_ was introduced, and it's become legendary, inspiring even new-gen anime like Jujutsu Kaisen. It's those moments that make Bleach iconic.\n\nHowever, there are some real issues. The world-building feels like a mess, starting with the decision to have Bleach take place on Earth in Japan. Why Japan? Why not go all in with a standalone world like Westeros in _Game of Thrones_ or the entire unique realm of One Piece? Ichigo being tied to Earth makes him feel less like a true shinigami. Why not make him a real shinigami from a smaller village or world, instead of trying to balance both Earth and Soul Society?\n\nAnd then there's the issue of side characters. Some, like Kenpachi, are amazing. Kenpachi is all about power, unpredictability, and absolute chaos in every fight — easily my favorite character. But other characters, especially those from the human world, just don't add anything. **Chad, Uryu, Orihime,** and even **Karin** feel pretty much pointless. It's like Ichigo is the main focus, while everyone else is just ... there. Uryu especially omg was this guy so useless and in the recent episode I watched of TYBW the author is trying to squeeze some emotion for him but I literally don't care at all.\n\nThe _Fullbringer Arc_ or _Lost Agent Arc_ was a low point. It felt like filler and barely contributed anything meaningful to the story. Bleach could have skipped this entirely, and we wouldn't have missed a thing. It's one of those arcs that makes you wish they'd cut the fluff and stick with the high-stakes fights and villains that made the story incredible.\n\n## The Ending: Ichigo vs. Aizen\n\nThe _Ichigo vs. Aizen_ fight was massive and intense, though it ended on an anticlimactic note. For a series that had been building up Aizen as this genius-level villain, the final blow felt ... underwhelming. Sure, it was cool, but it didn't live up to the tension that had been building throughout the arc.\n\n## Rating\n\nBleach is both amazing and flawed. It has some of the best moments and one of the best villains in shonen history, but it also suffers from unnecessary side characters, confusing world-building, and arcs that drag the story down. Despite that, I'd still rate it high for its standout moments and epic fights.\n\n**Rating: 13/20**\n",

From the Chunin Exams to Sasuke's departure, this review revisits the moments and themes that made Part 1 a shonen classic.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\n# Naruto Review Part 1\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  ![](https://i.namu.wiki/i/unwPJcZZr_AnbntHtRPLAM5bSWJIcHwEUuFnnRf05oLisFLgLIYS0rDLv2DIJQqbJDEw2uGD4VuyO9U7tZLERg.webp)\n</div>\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\n### How I started Naruto\n\nI first got into Naruto and Anime in general in 2014, back then I was totally oppsessed with Television and binging TV Shows but I had little to know knowledge of anime or manga ... all the Anime I knew was just Spacetoon which's a Kids channel in Arabic that aired popular stuff like Dragon Ball or Hunter X Hunter (Al Kanas) but I wasn't a regular watcher, I just happened to catch the odd episode here and there.\n\nThen in 2014, my cousin introduced me to this viral thing called **Anime** and appearantly it's Japanese originated (back then I thought it's just another thing from Europe/USA) and he told me to watch his favorite Anime Naruto so I said why not, I have a lot of free time and back then I used to love binging Naruto and the show had hundred of episodes when I started.\n\nFiller or not I watched it all and I didn't know what's what, I just finished it in record time. and here I will go through the journey again starting by reviewing the first part of the story.\n\n### Setting the Scene: Team 7's dynamic\n\nAfter graduating from the Ninja Academy, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura form Team 7 under the leadership of the experienced ninja Kakashi Hatake. This group is quite iconic in all anime and each had a pretty decent role at the start.\n\nIt's a hot take these days but Sakura got too much hate, at least in Part 1 rewatching it Sakura is a decent character. Meanwhile, I am not a fan of Sasuke to get things started, never been a fan of this arctype of character but to be honest looking at recent evolution of sasukes in new gen anime he is still leagues above what came after him.\n\nAs for Kakashi, he was decent. I know he is pretty popular but I never got the appeal. The mysterious persona got stale after time for me.\n\nNaruto on the other hand was absolutely and with no doubt the best of the group not just because of him being the main character or anything but also he felt to have the most agency and the best dialogue in my opinion, he stands out in team 7.\n\nOverall the dynamic of this team is like I said earlier iconic and inspired many and many new gen anime to copy it (ehm jjk).\n\n### The other teams\n\nIf I had to pick today who was my favorite teams aside from 7, it was easily Team 3, 10 and 8.\n\nTeam 3 because of Kiba, I think one of the most hilarious things looking back at it is Kiba saying he will be Hokage challenging Naruto. His powers were quite unique and pretty fun.\n\nTeam 10 has my GOAT, Shikamaru who has 2 of the 5 best fights in the story and overall just a great character and the most relatable one in animanga.\n\nTeam 3 or more commonly Team Guy, just simply the best group. The group with the most interesting storyline even more than Team 7 for me, except for the female of the group which fade in irrelevance. Guy, Rock Lee and Neji Hyuga are simply some of the greatest characters in animanga.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### The First Arc\n\nThe early arcs in _Naruto_ introduce us to the ninja world and let's be honest it is the most interesting concept as well ... Everyone as a kid wanted to be a Ninja not a Samurai or a Pirate.\n\nAlso I'm glad my first _real_ introduction into anime/manga came into a very rich world building not another japan/usa centered world ... I just think if you're gonna do a fantasy story don't do it in real world earth; make your own world.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/a/a2/Naruto_Hiding.png)\n</div>\n\nFirst with the Land of Waves arc being the standout starter. We explore all the hardships Naruto had to go through as an outcast, back then that was a pretty unique story and pretty engaging.\n\n### Chunin Exam (One of the Shonen Arcs of All Times)\n\nChunin Exam considered by many one of the greatest Shonen Arcs of all times and it only comes 35 chapters (20 episodes) in the story which helped imo Naruto a lot in the western audience who aren't as patience and just want to get to the meat as soon as possible (One Piece's biggest problem but these days they got past it) and [appearantly even Kishimoto was going the Oda route of Slow Pace but he got forced into creating this masterpiece](https://www.cbr.com/naruto-editors-forced-creator-write-chunin-exams-arc/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=Echobox-AMF&utm_medium=Social-Distribution&utm_source=Facebook&mibextid=Zxz2cZ#Echobox=1689603047).\n\nI can go on and on about how brilliant Chunin Exam but let's start from the beginning and Gaara is here. The arc starts with Naruto meeting Gaara and learning about the Chunin Exam with each nation sending their best genin trying to become Chunin and Konoha kind assembled the avengers 9 for this.\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/naruto-konoha-12-at-the-chunin-exams.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Chunin Exam Konoha's 9\"\n  className=\"w-full object-cover\"\n/>\n\nFrom the beginning everyone was waiting for Sasuke vs Gaara, the 2 prodigee and still to this day sad we didn't get the full conclusion of that (I think Sasuke would've won btw). Shikamaru's role here was dope too although back then I didn't really understand the plot around him, I just thought he is a fodder villain that will be defeated soon but I was wrong.\n\nAside from Sasuke/Shikamaru plotline, the main interesting thing is the Hyuga story that Naruto got into and it's for sure what elevated not just the arc but Part 1 as a whole, sad it was dropped later tho.\n\n### Naruto vs Sasuke and End of Part 1\n\n![](https://theanimescrolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Naruto-Vs-Sasuke-Final-Battle-Naruto.jpg)\n\nThe unfinished duel and the chase was exciting at least at this point of the story for me it was and I was even more excited to get to the _cool part_ where everyone grows and get stronger and have flashier abilities that I was promised ... little did I know I will miss the first part so much.\n\n## My Favorite Moments\n\n### Neji vs Naruto/Hinata\n\nNeji's fight with Naruto, as well as his clash with Hinata, are two of the most impactful battles in the series. They dive deep into the struggles of the Hyuga family, but more than that, they showcase Naruto's determination to break through any limit, that's what I originally thought, sadly part 2 had different plans for Neji, the greatest tragedy of Naruto's writing.\n\n### Lee vs Gaara\n\nLee's fight against Gaara is one of those unforgettable moments where every emotion is amplified. Seeing Lee open the Eight Gates to give everything he has was nothing short of legendary, and it shows his warrior spirit in the face of impossible odds.\n\nAnd ofc the iconic weights drop, no one will forget that.\n\n### Shikamaru\n\nI want to be a cloud too, it's the only fight I rewatch or have saved on my youtube. He is my favorite character without a doubt.\n\n## Rating\n\nSimply put, the first part of _Naruto_ is greatness in its purest form.

      "raw": "\n# Naruto Review Part 2 : Naruto Shippuden\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/naruto-and-sasuke-in-naruto-Cropped.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Naruto and Sasuke\"\n  className=\"h-full w-full object-cover\"\n/>\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nComing into Shippuden, this is what I was waiting for. Big Flashy fights with insane speed and good animation (comparetively ofc to it's time). And I'm not gonna act like I didn't get exactly that but rewatching it now, I really missed Naruto Part 1 and I will get into it more later.\n\nI got caught up to Naruto around 2015 Ramadan and that's when I switched from Anime to Manga for the first time cause I couldn't stop binging so Naruto is both my first Anime and first Manga.\n\nI will also probably do a list of anime openings some other time but if one thing Naruto Shippuden did right was the openings cause holly shit there were banger after banger each time, my favorite is for sure Hero's Comeback; it's such a vibe.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### Akatsuki Intro\n\nWe start after the 2 year timeskip training with Jiraya (another goated character) and ofc with the callback to the bell test off the rip ... it was all so good.\n\nAnd it kept getting better as we are introduced to the all time hall of famers , the **Akatsuki**, probably the most iconic villain group in animanga history ? I don't think the Spada of Aizen or whatever the letters of Yhawach or the Emperors really match up to their aura or and presence really.\n\nWith our first encounter is to Sasori and Deidara (Art is Explosition indeed or is that too meta for an arab), and they capture Gaara to extract his tail beast and this was a really fun plotline that put an appropriate amount of danger to the tail beast we knew especially Naruto who could be next.\n\nAnd here it is, Naruto meets Sasuke after the 2 year and... it was really bad like idk, like Sasuke's arc starting from here is something that I will always dislike no matter how many times I reread/rewatched it. I know many defend him and ironically same people would shit on Sakura but I will never vibe with Sasuke really.\n\n### Hidan\n\nOkay if I had to pick my top 3 moments in all of Shippuden it would be Pain, Hidan and Jiraya death. Hidan was so phenomenal man and ofc being a Shikamaru fanboy made me love this arc so much.\n\nRip to shikamaru sensei first off, then it was the first time in the story where I felt Team 7 wheren't the center of everything and Shikamaru had a really good moment defeating Hidan in a really good fight.\n\nOverall all Shikamaru fights are good fights to be honest, I just wish more authors did fights like that not flashy but technical; I think only Togashi still does those these days.\n\n### Taka and Deidara\n\nI didn't care, I thought Deidara's fight is dope but I knew he was gonna get clapped; as for Taka I never cared for them. I think the only time one of Taka got any emotion out of me is when I read first few chapters of Boruto then it got hinted at that Karin is maybe Sarada's mom and I bursted out laughing and that's really it then dropped Boruto after that.\n\n### Jiraya Death\n\n10/10 from setup to execution, it was simply perfect. not much else to say other than I think this did setup Pain and Conan as prime villains also mvp for jiraya for sending details to hidden leaf before he dies.\n\n### Itachi vs Sasuke\n\nNot a fan and it is what it is. Itachi's arc felt pointless and Sasuke is just Sasuke, he is the worst. And the fight itself wasn't anywhere near as good as previous Naruto fights. And the result of this fight that Sasuke learned Itachi was trying to protect him and hidden leaf village is wait for it ... yeah **destroy the leaf village.**\n\nWhatever man\n\n### Pain\n\nThe last good thing Naruto did really and I will stand on it that talk no jutsu was a good moment and the conclusion was good and this here should've been the end of the story tbh.\n\nThe story was about Naruto being an outcast and rejected by society but after the Pain arc he achieved that, He was already the hero of Konoha. All needed to do was Naruto to beat down Sasuke's ass and call it a day for the story.\n\n### 4Th Great Ninja War\n\nAlright this is a big ass arc, the first of many horrible big war arcs to come in animanga but I will go over what I disliked the most and the singular good thing about it at the end :\n\n- Sasuke being more of a Diva and attacking Hinata then Hinata turning and saying I love you to Naruto\n\n- The Reanimation Edo Tensei shit and White Jetsu (why the fuck did mha copy the worst aspect of Naruto with the Nomus , I will never understand)\n\n- Madara, he was a cool and because of that I would've forgave the terrible writing to bring him back ; but little did I know he got hoe'd for an ancient lady we heard about once.\n\n- Guy and Lee, and all the \"hard work pay off\" message from Part 1 is thrown out. You gotta be born gifted.\n\n- Neji, the story's biggest fumble did end up dying for the main family like it doesn't get funnier than that. You gotta be born in a better family.\n\n- Tobi/Obito's talk no jutsu on the other hand was not as good as pain, it was just corny.\n\n- Kagyua\n\nThat aside, 4th Great Ninja war was bad but the conclusion funny enough is good.\n\nNaruto vs Sasuke is the best thing about this long ass arc.\n\n## Rating\n\nAll and all a massive, massive let down compared to Part 1. Dropped so many key plot points that made Part 1 inspiring and special instead it became standard firework with no substance and I will die on the hill that the story should have ended after the Pain arc. We should have just had Naruto vs Sasuke after that and be done with it.\n\n**Rating: 11/20**\n",

      "raw": "\n![Next.js pass](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-1.webp)\n\n# What's new ?\n\nOn 24th Octobre we had Next.js conf24 an amazing event where the Vercel team shared the newest and latest updates about Next.js and its future trajectory.\n\nIn the conference there were some big updates followed by other small remarkable features, and the Keynotes started by unveiling 4 main goals they had for Next.js 15:\n\n- Make it Work\n\n- Make it Right\n\n- Make it Fast\n\n- Ship it\n\n## Make it Work :\n\nSo much complexity comes bundled in Next.js and React ecosystem as a whole and Server components came to simplify all of that Dynamic APIs (headers, cookies, searchParams...) and Route config options (revalidate, fetchCache...) and all the data fetching complexity.\n\n![Flight Code Demonstration](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-2.webp)\n\nSo Next.js 15 focused on simplifying data fetching and make it work like you expect with no magic or over caching.\n\n## Make it Right :\n\nTo make it right, you have to iterate over and over again to go from an idea to ship.\n\n![Idea to Ship](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-3.webp)\n\nAnd this is where _Turbopack_ came into prominence not just for speed but also for reliability and DX friendliness.\n\nIn the past Next.js had implicit errors but now it does an accurate diff and it tells you where you made an error especially for Hydration errors where I'm sure a lot of people have faced before.\n\nAnd now the Vercel team has officially announced that Turbopack is stable for dev server with parity with exiting compiler while expanding ecosystem compatibility and optimized cold compilation.\n\nWith the new Turbopack compiler it's 50% faster for initial compilation and up to 90% faster for code updates with fast refresh which's an insane improvement compared to the old compiler and they even tested it live on the Next.js website itself where it showed remarkable difference in speed.\n\nTurbopack is now finally Developement Stable but it's still not Build Stable as [you can still check the progress on AreWeTurboYet?](https://areweturboyet.com/) where it's 96% tests passing but those last 4% are the hardest to achieve so it will be a while before we hear another update about it.\n\n## Make it Fast:\n\nTurbopack was already a marvelous reveal for making it fast but this section was also really good as it was all about caching.\n\n\"use cache\" it's the latest and newest directive introduced by Next.js where it's by default it uses in process memory cache where it starts at memory but you can later configure it to any architecture you want.\n\nSimilar to \"use server\" and \"use client\", caching is now an opt-in experience unlike previously with Next.js.\n\nunstable_cache is now pretty much deprecated as \"use cache\" is considered it's successor.\n\nAlso for revalidation cacheTag and cacheLife are APIs introduced to give you more control on caching while getting rid of other deprecated methods like `fetch(\"\", { cache: \"no-store\"})` , `\"force-dynamic\"` , `\"force-cache\"` , `export const revalidate` etc... which weren't as intuitive to use.\n\n![use cache Code Demonstration](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-4.webp)\n\nShip it\nSelf-Hosting has been a huge issue for Next.js as it seemed hosting Next outside of Vercel felt impossible and it even sparked an entire Open Source Community dedicated to making Next.js truly Open Source and hostable anywhere called OpenNext and here the Vercel team renewed their commitement to making Next.js truly easy to host anywhere not just on Vercel.\n\nFirst they started by explaining that the docs lacked depth as it didn't explain all the key features of Next.js behind the scenes like Rendering, Caching/ISR and Image optimization that Vercel did for you behind the scenes and their first commitment is for Self-Hosting Education and to improve the docs overall.\n\nSecond, as mentioned in the previous section they made caching more customizable and easier to do so when deploying in Docker Containers you know how to adjust everything according to your needs.\n\nThird, Sharp Installation is now Automatic bundled with Next.js instead of their native WebAssembly for Image optimization because the latter used too much memory which would be a problem on a VPS.\n\nAnd finally Node.js middleware is now supported by Next.js and Vercel has partnered with many known self-hosting services to create adapters and docs under a [new Github organization Next.js](https://github.com/orgs/nextjs/repositories).\n",

Coming from _The Vampire Diaries_, viewers are introduced to a darker, more complex narrative that delves into themes of power, loyalty, and the weight of family legacy. Klaus Mikaelson's return to New Orleans ignites a power struggle that will have lasting consequences for all involved.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### Introduction to New Orleans\n\nThe season begins with Klaus and Elijah returning to New Orleans, a city they once ruled. Klaus, who has been hiding from the past and the consequences of his actions, is determined to reclaim his place as the king of the supernatural community. However, he finds that Marcel, a former protégé, has taken control of the city and its vampire population. This sets the stage for a fierce rivalry between Klaus and Marcel.\n\n### Key Characters\n\n- **Klaus Mikaelson**: A complex anti-hero, Klaus struggles with his dual nature as both a vampire and a hybrid. His desire for power often clashes with his feelings for his family, particularly his brother Elijah.\n- **Elijah Mikaelson**: The honorable brother, Elijah seeks to protect his family and navigate the complexities of their legacy. He often finds himself torn between loyalty to Klaus and the need to do what is right.\n- **Marcel Gerard**: A charismatic leader of the New Orleans vampires, Marcel embodies the challenges Klaus faces in reclaiming his throne. His backstory with Klaus adds layers to their conflict.\n- **Hayley Marshall**: A werewolf with a mysterious past, Hayley becomes entangled in the Mikaelson family dynamics. Her connection to Klaus and her desire to protect her own kind make her a pivotal character.\n- **Sophie Deveraux**: A witch who plays a significant role in the supernatural politics of New Orleans, Sophie aims to reclaim the power of her coven and protect her family.\n\n### Central Conflicts\n\nThe season explores several central conflicts:\n\n1. **Klaus vs. Marcel**: The rivalry between Klaus and Marcel drives much of the plot. Klaus seeks to re-establish his dominance, while Marcel is determined to maintain his grip on power.\n2. **Family Dynamics**: The complexities of the Mikaelson family are at the forefront, particularly the bond between Klaus and Elijah. Their relationship is tested as they navigate alliances and betrayals.\n\n3. **Witch vs. Vampire Politics**: The power struggle extends beyond the Mikaelsons and Marcel, as witches in New Orleans seek to regain their influence. The season introduces tensions between the supernatural factions, emphasizing the fragile balance of power.\n\n### Key Moments\n\n- **Klaus's Return**: The opening episode effectively establishes Klaus's character and his motivations, highlighting his ruthless pursuit of power.\n- **Elijah's Loyalty**: Elijah's commitment to his family is showcased, particularly in his efforts to mediate between Klaus and Marcel.\n- **The Witch Coven**: Sophie's attempts to unite the witches against the vampires add an intriguing layer to the plot, showcasing the complexities of supernatural alliances.\n\n## Character Development\n\nThroughout the season, we witness significant character development:\n\n- **Klaus** evolves from a power-hungry villain to a more nuanced character grappling with his insecurities and the consequences of his actions.\n- **Elijah** remains a moral compass, continually trying to rein in Klaus's more reckless tendencies while navigating the intricate politics of New Orleans.\n- **Hayley** grows from a mysterious outsider to a key player in the Mikaelson family drama, exploring her own identity and ties to the werewolf community.\n\n## Overall Impression\n\nThe first season of _The Originals_ successfully establishes a rich narrative filled with intrigue, family drama, and supernatural politics. The dynamic between Klaus and Marcel creates tension, while the exploration of witch and vampire relationships adds depth to the story.\n\n### Rating\n\n**Rating: 19/20**\n\nThe season excels in character development, world-building, and storytelling, making it a standout introduction to the series.\n",

      "raw": "\n# The Originals Season 5 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nSeason 5 marks the final chapter in the _The Originals_ saga, wrapping up the story of the Mikaelson family as they confront new threats and grapple with the consequences of their past. The season blends emotional farewells with intense supernatural conflicts, leaving a lasting impact on viewers.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### Time Jump and New Challenges\n\nThe season begins with a significant time jump, showcasing the aftermath of the events from Season 4. The Mikaelsons are forced to confront the repercussions of their actions and the new threats that arise in their absence.\n\n### Key Characters\n\n- **Klaus Mikaelson**: Klaus remains a central figure, navigating his complicated relationship with Hope and the responsibilities of being a father. His character development reaches new heights as he faces both external dangers and his internal struggles.\n- **Elijah Mikaelson**: Elijah's loyalty and dedication to his family are put to the test, showcasing his growth and commitment to protecting those he loves.\n- **Hope Mikaelson**: Hope's journey takes center stage as she grapples with her identity and the legacy of her family. Her character development is a highlight of the season.\n- **Hayley Marshall**: Hayley's fierce protectiveness toward Hope remains a driving force in the narrative, showcasing her strength as a mother and leader.\n- **Freya Mikaelson**: Freya's role expands as she navigates her own challenges and supports her family in the face of new threats.\n\n### Central Conflicts\n\n1. **Klaus and Hope's Relationship**: The father-daughter dynamic is explored deeply, emphasizing the complexities of their relationship as they confront external challenges and their family's legacy.\n\n2. **Emergence of New Threats**: As the Mikaelsons face new adversaries, the season highlights the importance of unity and family bonds in overcoming obstacles.\n\n3. **Elijah's Struggles**: Elijah's internal conflicts and his desire to protect his family lead to significant character development, culminating in crucial moments of sacrifice and growth.\n\n### Key Moments\n\n- **The Return of Familiar Faces**: The season brings back beloved characters, deepening the emotional stakes and allowing for nostalgic moments that resonate with long-time fans.\n- **Hope's Growth**: Hope's journey toward embracing her identity as a Mikaelson adds depth to the season, showcasing her evolution and the weight of her family's legacy.\n- **Emotional Farewells**: As the season progresses, the emotional farewells of key characters create a poignant atmosphere, highlighting the themes of love, sacrifice, and the enduring bond of family.\n\n## Overall Impression\n\nSeason 5 of _The Originals_ successfully concludes the story of the Mikaelson family, blending intense conflicts with heartfelt moments. The character development, particularly for Klaus and Hope, creates an emotional resonance that makes this season memorable.\n\n### Rating\n\n**Rating: 16/20**\n\nThe combination of thrilling supernatural elements and emotional depth makes Season 5 a fitting conclusion to the series, while still leaving a lasting impression on the audience.\n\n## Thoughts on _Legacies_\n\nAs a spin-off, _Legacies_ has been a significant disappointment. It strays from the darker, more complex tone of _The Vampire Diaries_ and _The Originals_, opting for a lighthearted, humorous approach that feels out of place within the established universe.\n\nThe characters of Hope and Alaric deserved a show that respected the legacy of their predecessors rather than one that diluted the intensity and emotional weight that fans loved. The humorous tone undermines the serious themes explored in the original series, making it feel like a completely different world.\n\nAfter dropping _Legacies_ after Season 1, I can confidently say that it failed to capture the essence of what made _The Originals_ and _TVD_ so compelling.

He was older than me by 4 years so He was always the one to introduce me to a lot of things and this time around he described me this epic fantasy of vampire and werewolves so I was totally into it.\n\nBack then I watched Season 1 in French as I barely understood english (nor did I understand much french but it was better as we learn French before English for some reason in our Education system) but then I rewatched the show couple of times in English later down the years when I learned the language and the voices totally freaked me out :sob:\n\n### The living in the shadow mystery\n\nThis trope completely hooked me and with later shows that I will review this stays as my absolute favorite one to watch, having the double identity and trying to juggle between and balance them was always a really cool one and here comes Stephen Salvatore, a recent transfered high schooler to Mystic Falls with everything looking normal at first for us to later discover he is a vampire.\n\n### The Evil Brother\n\nThe show was already very interesting from the get go, but it went from great to amazing after the introduction of Damon Salvatore. He was simply a showstopper, the savagery and the overall badass attitude was top notch. Al though for season 1 Damon was portrayed way more vilanous than I even remember him to be, He was kinda wild tbh especially what he did to Caroline and that whole B plotline.\n\n### The love Triangle\n\nI wasn't as big of a fan of the love stories when I first started, I was much more looking into supernatural vampires going wild, my mind changes as the seasons evolve but still not my main interest when I started TVD.\n\n![](/images/content/tvshows/the-vampire-diaries-review-season-1.webp)\n\n# The Plot of Season 1\n\n## First half\n\nSeason 1 was basically about Stephen vs Damon and them chasing after Katherine a mysterious figure from their past that resembled Elena. We start with Elena Gilbert who had her parents pass away last year in a trajic car accident and where Elena magically survived. We also meet various prominent characters that I will talk about later.\n\nThe season progressed where Elena slowly unveil the lies around her and discover what's happening. I think one of my favorite moments early on is when Stephan offered vervain(?) neckless to Elena that would stop Damon's manipulation and that resulted in him getting slapped for asking for a kiss.\n\nAnother plotline that ran alongside the main one was the Gilbert watch with the sheriff and the maire(?) of the town and that would have the crescendo of this season.\n\n## Second half\n\nThings ramp up in the second half of the season when Vicki died after Stephen turned her into a vampire and her unable to control herself which also led Jeremy to a depression arc that I wasn't a fan of ... Later on we finally discover what Damon has been trying to do when he returned to Mystic Falls and it's not to mess with Stephen and Elena but instead it was to free Katherine, the original love for the brothers.\n\nAnd here comes the fun, 25 vampires are on the loose and the big twist is that **Katherine was never there** to begin with and it's revealed that their whole relationship is a lie really.\n\nFirst Katherine aside, the most interesting plot during this stretch for me atleast is Jeremy's relationship with Anna. I don't care what anyone says but Jer and Anna were the perfect couple back then and it's really shame she died and goes without a saying I wanted him to turn into a Vampire would've been really cool.\n\n## Finale : Werewolf reveal\n\nI was waiting for it the whole season anyway, where are the werewolfs my cousin promised. It's supposed to be Vampires vs Werewolves and here we are it's the Lockwood family.\n\nDuring the finale the device that disrubted supernatural figures (but not witches i think ?) was kinda interesting and delievered on it's promise and hype while the season ends with the reveal it also ends with Jeremy trying to turn into a Vampire which I also wanted really bad.\n\n# Character Notes\n\nPretty much these are my thoughts of the main characters during Season 1 :\n\n- Stephan Salvatore : All things considered Stephan was the star of the show and my favorite thing of Season 1 from his hidden mysteries to his dark past and the whole plot of his uncontrollable state when he drinks blood was really entertaining and kept a variant of surprise.\n\n- Elena Gilbert : She was okay, I never been an Elena enjoyer. She had numerous great scenes with Damon being the freak of nature that he represented this season.\n\n- Damon Salvatore : Absolute freak, with later season knowledge I even forgot how wild Damon was in early seasons and for sure my second favorite character of the season.\n\n- Jeremy Gilbert : Really Entertaining, even tho I said I'm not interested in romantic relationships and just wanted supernatural chaos but his with Vicki then with Anna were really good this season and overall a solid character.\n\n- Bonnie Bennett : Spoiler alert, my overall favorite character of the show but She was sidelined in the first season as the show hasn't explored the Witch side of supernaturals.\n\n- Caroline Forbes : Lol, just felt bad for her for most of the season but nothing else.\n\n- Alaric Saltzman : Great story, sympathatic and all. He was a great addition in the second half and went on to be one of the best characters in the franchise.\n\n# Rating\n\nThe mix of romance, supernatural action, and drama works well, creating an addictive season 1. The characters were really amazing overall but the plot kinda stalled and tbh that stalling is kind of the charm of early seasons.\n\n**Rating : 14/20**\n",

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 2 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nSeason 2 of _The Vampire Diaries_ is where the series goes all in, and I'm here for it. Everything that made Season 1 intriguing gets amplified, with ruthless new characters and high-stakes conflicts that give Mystic Falls an edge I didn't know it needed. And let's be real—this season is all about **Katherine Pierce**. Her entry adds a whole new level of excitement and danger, giving _TVD_ a much-needed jolt.\n\nOh, and a huge shoutout to the Originals. Their presence, especially Klaus, took the story to another level, introducing a rich backstory and layers of tension that grounded the supernatural drama with gravitas.\n\n## Katherine Pierce: The Queen of Chaos\n\nKatherine was a breath of fresh air after a season of Elena's moral dilemmas. She's cunning, merciless, and endlessly entertaining—a character who owns every scene she's in. Her ruthlessness was everything I wanted from a vampire villain, giving the show a raw, unpredictable energy that kept me hooked. Unlike Elena, who often felt reactive, Katherine was always a step ahead, manipulating events to suit her own goals. Her unpredictability raised the stakes in a way that felt genuinely thrilling, and seeing her bring out sides of Damon and Stefan we hadn't seen before was gold.\n\n## The Originals & Klaus: Power and Intrigue\n\nEnter the Originals, and _TVD_ levels up. The mythology around the Originals, with Klaus at the helm, was brilliantly done. Klaus' relentless pursuit of breaking the curse added layers to the plot and set him up as a character who is both terrifying and oddly charismatic. His dynamic with the other characters, especially the Salvatore brothers and Katherine, created moments that were intense and unforgettable. It's easy to say that the addition of the Originals elevated _TVD_ into something grander, making it more than just another teen vampire show.\n\n## Key Plot Points\n\n### The Doppelgänger Revelation\n\nThe twist surrounding Elena's identity as a doppelgänger made for a brilliant arc, deepening her connection to Katherine and the Originals. The reveal that her existence ties directly into Klaus's plans for breaking the curse was well-executed and gave Elena's character a purpose beyond just being caught between two vampires.\n\n### The Werewolf Element\n\nThe werewolf curse on Tyler and its connection to Klaus introduced an intriguing new layer to the supernatural lore in _TVD_. Tyler's transformation was brutal and raw, depicting the darker, less glamorous side of supernatural life. This storyline grounded the show, emphasizing the painful, uncontrollable aspect of being a werewolf, which balanced the otherwise flashy vampiric drama.\n\n### Damon and Stefan's Complexity\n\nDamon and Stefan were a rollercoaster this season. Damon's softer side starts peeking through, but Katherine's presence keeps him as sharp and unpredictable as ever. Stefan, meanwhile, grapples with the Katherine trauma he's buried for so long. Their dynamic with Katherine made this a season of emotional highs and lows, adding to the depth of the show's core relationships.\n\n### Klaus' Ritual and Sacrifice\n\nThe build-up to Klaus's ritual to break the curse brought all the season's plotlines to a head in a thrilling and tragic way. The tension during the sacrifice scene was palpable, and while Elena's survival was expected, the path it took to get there was impactful. Klaus as the ultimate villain was unmatched—calculating, manipulative, and effortlessly cruel.\n\n## Rating\n\nSeason 2 exceeded my expectations with a darker, more complex story that brought Katherine and the Originals to the forefront. This season took _TVD_ from a good show to an unmissable one, with characters that were rich, multi-layered, and memorable. For the ruthless Katherine, the power dynamics introduced by Klaus, and the unrelenting tension in every episode, **I'm giving Season 2 a solid 17/20**.\n",

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 3 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nSeason 3 continues to build on the strong Originals vs. Mystic Falls crew dynamic that Season 2 introduced, and it takes the show's intensity to new heights. Watching Klaus, Elijah, and the other Originals clash with the main trio gives this season an edge that I found thrilling. The dark alliances, betrayals, and back-and-forth of power only strengthen the characters and relationships we've been following.\n\nThe finale twist with Elena becoming a vampire is the season's perfect capstone—high stakes that change the game entirely. This moment and its lead-up made Season 3 feel like a turning point, and I'm fully here for it.\n\n## The Originals' Impact\n\nThe Originals' presence really elevated the story. Klaus, in particular, remains such a standout villain: charming, brutal, and unpredictable. His complex dynamic with his siblings and desire to build a hybrid family set a perfect foundation for some of the season's best storylines.\n\nElijah's return and his loyalty conflicts added layers to the Originals arc, making the tension between the Mystic Falls crew and these ancient vampires even more fascinating. The Originals didn't just bring supernatural power but depth to the narrative, influencing every main character.\n\n## Plot Highlights\n\n### Stefan's Ripper Arc\n\nStefan's descent into his “Ripper” phase was a bold move that added a darker shade to his character. The push-pull between Klaus and Stefan gave us some incredible moments, and seeing Stefan struggle with his dual nature—especially after being forced into it by Klaus—was one of the season's highlights.\n\n### Damon and Elena's Chemistry\n\nDamon and Elena's growing chemistry added another layer of tension to the trio. Damon's unpredictability and undeniable pull toward Elena, coupled with her conflicted feelings, created some fantastic scenes. It was a shift from the Stefan-Elena romance and kept things fresh without feeling forced.\n\n### The Finale Twist - Elena's Transition\n\nThe season ends on a massive cliffhanger: Elena's transition into a vampire. This twist is game-changing, redefining her character and upping the stakes for everyone around her. Watching Elena grapple with this transformation promises a whole new direction for the show and raises the excitement for Season 4.\n\n## Character Notes\n\n- **Elena Gilbert:** She's gone through so much, and her transition feels like the ultimate consequence of the life she's been drawn into.\n- **Stefan Salvatore:** Seeing him embrace his dark side under Klaus's influence added new complexity.\n- **Damon Salvatore:** His growth and feelings for Elena came through beautifully this season.\n- **Klaus Mikaelson:** Simply one of the best villains on TV, adding depth and menace to every scene.\n- **Elijah Mikaelson:** The honorable, complex brother of Klaus, creating a balance within the Originals.\n\n## Rating\n\nSeason 3 is a thrill ride, masterfully blending character drama and supernatural intrigue, particularly with the Originals' storyline. With Elena's transition, the show feels poised to explore even darker, bolder territories.\n\n**Rating: 17/20**\n",

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 4 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nSeason 4 continues to explore the aftermath of Elena's transformation into a vampire. The show dives deeper into the complexities of her new identity while balancing the ongoing conflicts with the Originals. This season really showcased the duality of Elena's character and how her relationships evolve under the pressure of her transformation.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### Main Plot Points\n\n- **Elena's Transition**: The season revolves around Elena grappling with her new vampire identity and the challenges that come with it, including her humanity switch.\n- **Hunter's Mark**: The plot involving Jeremy and Caroline discovering the Hunter's mark is a highlight, bringing thrilling new elements to the story.\n- **The Search for the Cure**: While it was a central plot, I found the chase for the cure to be less compelling compared to other arcs in the series.\n- **Bonnie Bennett's Growth**: Bonnie shines this season, showcasing her growth and power as a witch, making her one of the standout characters.\n- **Klaus and the Originals**: The presence of the Originals continues to elevate the storyline. Klaus and his family add layers of complexity and excitement to the series.\n\n## Character Notes\n\n- **Elena Gilbert**: Her struggles with her vampire identity were relatable, but her humanity switch felt drawn out and uninspired at times.\n- **Jeremy Gilbert**: The Hunter's mark plot gave Jeremy a purpose and an interesting arc this season.\n- **Bonnie Bennett**: As always, Bonnie is a highlight, showcasing her strength and development throughout the season.\n- **Klaus Mikaelson**: The introduction of _The Originals_ spin-off is a significant highlight, as Klaus's character adds depth and excitement to the series. In my opinion, this spin-off is even better than _The Vampire Diaries_ itself, and I plan to review it later.\n\n## Rating\n\nSeason 4 was a mixed bag for me. While I enjoyed the Hunter's mark plot with Jeremy and Caroline and appreciated Bonnie's character development, the chase for the cure didn't resonate as strongly. Additionally, Elena's humanity switch was a dull point in the season. Overall, I rate this season a **15/20**.\n",

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 5 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nAfter the thrilling arcs of the previous seasons, I approached Season 5 with high expectations. However, the excitement quickly fizzled out, leaving me feeling like I was watching a different show altogether.\n\n## The Plot of Season 5\n\nThis season dives into new storylines and introduces several characters, but ultimately feels like a step down from the intensity and intrigue of the earlier seasons. The overall direction didn't resonate with me, leading to a lack of engagement.\n\n### Key Plot Points\n\n- **College Life**: The characters transition to college, but the dynamics feel forced and less compelling compared to their high school experiences.\n- **New Characters**: Several new faces are introduced, but they fail to make a significant impact on the storyline or character development.\n- **Romantic Drama**: The love stories take center stage, but they lack the depth and excitement of previous seasons.\n- **Return of Old Foes**: While some familiar faces return, their storylines don't hold the same weight as before.\n\n## Character Notes\n\n- **Elena Gilbert**: Her journey this season felt stagnant, and the lack of character growth was disappointing.\n- **Damon Salvatore**: Still a standout character, but even his charm couldn't save the season from feeling lackluster.\n- **Stefan Salvatore**: His character arc was underwhelming, and I found myself wishing for more depth and intrigue.\n- **Bonnie Bennett**: A highlight once again, but I felt her potential was not fully utilized this season.\n\n## Rating\n\nOverall, Season 5 was a letdown compared to its predecessors.

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 6 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nAfter the letdown of Season 5, Season 6 felt like a refreshing return to form. With a strong focus on character development and engaging storylines, this season delivered some of the best moments in the series, particularly for my three favorite characters: Bonnie, Damon, and the unforgettable Kai Parker.\n\n## The Plot of Season 6\n\nThis season explores the consequences of Elena's departure, setting the stage for significant growth among the remaining characters. The storyline revolves around Bonnie's struggle, Damon's journey towards redemption, and Kai Parker's chaotic charm that adds a thrilling edge to the season.\n\n### Key Plot Points\n\n- **Bonnie Bennett's Arc**: Bonnie is thrust into a prominent role this season, facing immense challenges as she navigates her new reality. Her strength and resilience shine through as she grapples with the consequences of her magical abilities. Bonnie's character development is particularly compelling as she evolves from a supporting character into a central figure, showcasing her determination and wit.\n- **Damon Salvatore's Redemption**: Damon's journey towards redemption is fraught with obstacles, but his character remains captivating throughout. His interactions with Bonnie deepen their friendship and provide some of the season's most heartfelt moments. Damon's struggle to find balance between his darker instincts and the desire to be a better person is well portrayed.\n\n- **Kai Parker's Introduction**: Kai Parker bursts onto the scene as a standout character, bringing an exhilarating mix of charm and chaos. His unpredictability keeps viewers on edge, and his dynamic with Bonnie adds layers to both characters. Kai's badass attitude and clever manipulation make him a formidable foe, and his interactions with the main cast provide some of the season's best dialogue and tension.\n\n- **Elena's Farewell**: While Elena's exit from the series is emotional, it allows the remaining characters to evolve beyond the love triangle that previously defined them. The farewell is bittersweet, marking the end of an era while paving the way for new dynamics and growth among the core characters.\n\n## Rating\n\nSeason 6 stands out as one of the best stretches in the series, with powerful storytelling and character arcs.

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 7 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nSeason 7 marks a turning point for several characters, particularly Caroline Forbes. For the first time, I felt her character truly shined, but the season also introduced new dynamics and challenges that complicated the overall narrative.\n\n## The Plot of Season 7\n\nThis season dives into the aftermath of Elena's departure, exploring how the remaining characters cope with the loss and the new threats that arise. Caroline's evolution as a character is a highlight, but the introduction of Enzo detracts from the season's strengths.\n\n### Key Plot Points\n\n- **Caroline Forbes' Development**: Season 7 is a turning point for Caroline, showcasing her growth as a character. Her role as a parent brings out a new side of her, demonstrating her nurturing qualities and depth. However, the bittersweet nature of her character arc is overshadowed by her later involvement in the creation of \"Legacies\", which's the worst show ever and I hate her kids in that show but whatever, I will get into it on TO review.\n\n- **Bonnie and Damon's Friendship**: The dynamic between Bonnie and Damon continues to flourish this season, adding a layer of complexity to their relationship. Their friendship is heartwarming, especially as Damon grapples with the idea of losing Bonnie while waiting for her to die. This tension creates a poignant backdrop for their interactions, highlighting their deep bond and unwavering support for each other.\n\n- **Enzo's Impact**: Unfortunately, Enzo's introduction does not resonate with me. His character feels out of place, and his relationship with Bonnie creates a contrast that I found less engaging. His presence detracts from the compelling friendships and dynamics that defined previous seasons.\n\n## Rating\n\nWhile Season 7 presents some engaging character developments, particularly for Caroline and the continued growth of Bonnie and Damon's friendship, the introduction of the annoying Enzo hinder my overall enjoyment.\n\n**Rating: 12/20**\n",

      "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 8 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\nSeason 8 of _The Vampire Diaries_ was a disappointing experience for me, feeling more like a chore than an engaging watch. The contrast between this season and the brilliance of _The Originals_ is stark and highlights the decline in quality that _TVD_ suffers in its final stretch.\n\n## The Plot of Season 8\n\nThis season feels like a series of missed opportunities, with plotlines that drag on and fail to deliver the excitement and depth that earlier seasons brought. The pacing is off, and the stakes seem lower, making it difficult to stay invested in the characters and their journeys.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Overall Boredom**: The narrative felt repetitive and lacked the tension that characterized earlier seasons. The excitement and urgency of the storylines have diminished significantly, making for an overall boring experience.\n\n- **Wasted Potential**: Many plot points feel like a waste of time, as if the writers struggled to find a compelling direction for the story. The introduction of new threats and characters does little to revive the interest in the series, and by this point, I felt that _TVD_ should have concluded after Season 6.\n\n- **Contrast with _The Originals_**: Watching _The Vampire Diaries_ alongside _The Originals_ only accentuates the flaws in the former. The richness of storytelling and character development in _The Originals_ makes _TVD_'s shortcomings even more glaring.\n\n## Rating\n\nUltimately, Season 8 of _The Vampire Diaries_ left me feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. It feels like a hollow conclusion to a series that once had so much potential.\n\n**Rating: 10/20**\n",
