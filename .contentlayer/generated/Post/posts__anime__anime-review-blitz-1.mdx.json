Some hit hard, some missed the mark completely, and others fell somewhere in the middle. Here's my take on each one, with an eye toward what worked and what didn't.\n\n---\n\n## Black Clover (Episodes 1-170) - **12/20**\n\nBlack Clover starts with an interesting premise but quickly loses steam for me. Like I expected something similar to Fairy Tail or Naruto, something grand and epic and I kinda did get that ... I think all things considered I did like BC but it didn't reach the heights of the other stories that I watched/read by then at least up until Episode 170.\n\nI will be completely honest, one thing that _really_ bothered me was Asta's voice because for some reason I decided to watch it as dubbed and it's an all time worst casting I heard like my eardrumbs could not keep up with the constant screaming. But hey I got through it.\n\nAnother thing that I did not like would be Yuno, I just don't care for that archtype of character ; just too boring and he reminds me of Bleach's uyru (maybe he is not as useless as uryu) but he just felt too bland.\n\nWhile Asta's journey to becoming the Wizard King has its exciting moments, the series is weighed down by a predictable plot. The characters have their charm, and this is probably my favorite thing about Black Clover, I really love the black bulls (maybe not the nose bleeding dude) but it's warming to see such a good team dynamic like One Piece's StrawHats.\n\n---\n\n## Blue Exorcist - **9/20**\n\nBlue Exorcist had the setup for a strong story—a half-demon teen who fights against his heritage while training to be an exorcist. However, the show quickly diverges into repetitive, formulaic arcs, with limited character growth. Despite a few standout battles and Rin's rebellious energy, it felt like a typical supernatural shonen that didn't fully live up to its potential.\n\n---\n\n## Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion - **12/20**\n\n_Code Geass_ is famous for its intense political plots and the high-stakes tactics of Lelouch Lamperouge. His transformation from a scheming anti-hero into a tragic figure is both compelling and twisted, but the plot twists sometimes feel forced. The show is gripping but occasionally too convoluted for its own good. Still, Lelouch is a fascinating character, even if the show's ambition sometimes overrides its clarity.\n\nAlso L/Kira are smarter, I know this was a debate back in the day but the debate is wrong.\n\n---\n\n## Cowboy Bebop - **13/20**\n\nThis iconic series is stylish, atmospheric, and defined by its complex, moody characters and episodic adventures. Spike Spiegel and his ragtag crew deliver an unforgettable space western experience, yet the series' slow pace and loose narrative aren't always for everyone. The strong visuals, music, and philosophical themes left an impression, but as a whole, it didn't captivate me as much as I hoped.\n\nOh also I made the mistake of watching the Live Action, if you are considering it; don't.\n\n---\n\n## Mob Psycho 100 - **16/20**\n\n_Mob Psycho 100_ is a solid, tightly woven story about psychic powers, self-discovery, and the strength found in vulnerability. Watching Mob grow emotionally while contending with immense power made for a powerful character arc, especially with a beautifully wrapped-up ending. The story's uniqueness and heart elevated it to one of the best in the genre, along with standout animation and humor that clicked.\n\nOne of my favorites of all time for sure, I really really loved Mob's character arc and the ending is surprisngly perfect which's hard to do in shows these days.\n\n---\n\n## Monster - **6/20**\n\n_Monster_ is a highly acclaimed psychological thriller, but it didn't resonate with me. While the premise of a doctor-turned-detective chasing a sociopathic killer through Eastern Europe is unique, the story's slow, plodding pace detracted from the suspense. The moral and ethical questions are intriguing, yet the show's length feels unnecessarily stretched, making it difficult to stay engaged.\n\n---\n\n## One Punch Man - **13/20**\n\nOne Punch Man's absurd premise—a hero who defeats all enemies with one punch—blends humor and action, though the novelty of Saitama's overpowered shtick wears thin over time. The characters like Genos add depth to the story, but it's best enjoyed as a humorous parody of the shonen genre rather than for its plot depth. Season 1's animation is legendary, but the thrill lessens with repetition.\n\nOverall it feels like firework comedy but nothing beyond it and it's fine with me. I will probably consider reading the manga since the art is crazy good there.\n\n---\n\n## Spy x Family - **12/20**\n\nSpy x Family's quirky family dynamic and premise had a ton of potential, following an elite spy who must build a “pretend” family to complete his mission. The comedy, action, and relationships are enjoyable, but it struggles with pacing, and the plot sometimes feels more slice-of-life than spy thriller. Anya's innocence and telepathic abilities provide charm, though the overall series didn't have enough high stakes to keep me hooked.\n\nReally looking forward to the next season, it's a great slice of life.\n\n---\n\n## Steins;Gate - **10/20**\n\n_Steins;Gate_ explores time travel and conspiracy theories, and it has an intriguing, mind-bending plot. The protagonist's journey is complex, but the show's slow build-up and convoluted time-loop mechanics made it feel tedious. Although the plot eventually takes off, the confusing structure took away from my enjoyment, leaving it as an interesting, if uneven, viewing experience.\n\n---\n\n## The Promised Neverland - **12/20**\n\nSeason 1 of _The Promised Neverland_ had me completely hooked. The twist was shocking, with genuinely creepy moments and brilliant suspense.\n\nHowever, Season 2 was a huge disappointment. The plot abandoned much of the mystery, cutting corners in a way that felt rushed and unsatisfying. It's a shame, as the first season set up what could have been an outstanding series.\n\n---\n\n## To Your Eternity - **11/20**\n\nThis anime started strong with an emotional, philosophical premise about an immortal entity learning about life, love, and loss.\n\nThe first season was compelling and deeply moving, but the second season lost focus, dragging out the narrative. It's a series with a beautiful premise that got bogged down as it progressed, making it hard to maintain the emotional connection.\n\nAnd it kinda got repetitive/tiring after a while, like everyone dies and the cycle continues :sob: and I honestly don't understand the end game of the creatures that keep popping up.\n\n---\n\n## Tokyo Revengers - **4/20**\n\n_Tokyo Revengers_ is one of the most mid shows I've watched. The time-traveling plot concept is interesting, but the execution is seriously flawed.\n\nWHERE ARE THE PARENTS, that's the only question I had when middle schoolers are acting up like gangs. like what even is going on ... I ended up dropping it after it got more boring in season 2 ... I think the only interesting moment was the end of s1 where the villain or at least the assumed villains apologize to the mc then it ends there.\n\n---\n\n## Ranking of Kings - **7/20**\n\n_Ranking of Kings_ brings a unique, fairy-tale style approach, following a deaf prince with an unbreakable spirit. But it was simply not my cup of tee really so I just dropped it.\n\n---\n\n## Kuroko no Basket - **10/20**\n\nAhh sports anime ... Great concept in theory but fumbled more often than not, Kuroko is one of the few I watched back in the day ... I think it's _fine_, it's neither bad nor great that's why it's in the dead middle at 10 but I will get into this in other reviews where I go into the new Sports anime individually on what they did right or wrong.\n\n_Kuroko no Basket_ is over the top which's what I really dislike cause I would've prefered a more grounded approche to it. But at the end it was okay and that's my take on it.\n\n---\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThese anime series cover a lot of ground, from supernatural adventures to sci-fi thrillers, sports, and slice-of-life. While some were unforgettable, others felt like a letdown, with pacing and plot execution issues that made them hard to stay engaged with. _Mob Psycho_ stood out as a highlight for me, while _Tokyo Revengers_ and _Monster_ were among the biggest disappointments. It's been a fun journey through different genres, and there's always something new to try in the anime world!\n",
