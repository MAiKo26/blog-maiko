    "raw": "\n# Hunter X Hunter Chapter 405\n\n![](https://cdn.onepiecechapters.com/file/CDN-M-A-N/hxh_405_m_002.png)\n\nSucession Arc is already the best Arc in HxH and in contention to be the greatest arc in all of Anime/Manga, and if it doesn't then Togashi would have dropped the ball cause the cast for this Arc is unlike any other I ever seen.\n\nThis chapter starts with a popular theory in the community confirmed, that Hisoka that we saw in 393 is a fake indeed, it's Bonolenov disguising as Hisoka with instructions from Chrollo although I don't know why, like Bono clearly can't hang with Hisoka nor most of the characters in Tier 1 and he is at massive risk there so what's his objective ?\n\nAlso how can he communicate with the rest of the Troupe in lower tiers... For now he is just lurking I guess and gathering info.\n\nChrollo clearly is ready for a rematch and is hunting for abilities and I would love him to get Halkenburg or Camilla's nen beast abilities but idk if he can get the nen beast themselves I guess we will find out.\n\nWe hear Hisoka and it's undoubtly him this time, he gives us his thoughts on the ants and the princes and even tho it's kinda of cope like Hisoka would get destroyed by the mereum or his trio but I love that he copes; he gotta keep the allure of being the strongest and hunting for that pleasure of a one-on-one. He will have plenty of opportunities on the ship, not just the troupe but also Beyond and maybe Ging are here so how would he react to all these monsters.\n\nChrollo assumes Hisoka is working with a prince, I think it's either Kurapika calling for an old friend's help or Luzurus/Zhang Lei; I can't see the other princes conserned with the lower tiers dramas. That said another interesting thing about the Chrollo scene is obviously the guy that trafficated Sarada has been killed by the troupes 10 years ago but they are still on this murderous path anyway and still committed the kurta massacre after that and it gets more and more confusing as an incident.\n\nI think Togashi is making it to obvious that Hisoka vs Chrollo is the thing to look for but in reality I think Kurapika vs Hisoka is what will occur, also keep in mind the tatto guy that was with Linsorth is potentially Tseri's friend so that could be a major plotpoint to remember.\n\nFinally, the final stretch of the chapter is setting up the strongest trio of The Troupe after Chrollo to go after Morena and I hope they finish this plotpoint fast so we can get to tier 1; Like I love the mafia wars but it's for sure a B plotpoint compared to the sucession war in tier 1.\n\nI think if Hisoka will ever fight another Troupe it will be Nobunga as it's hinted so many times that Nobunga finds Hisoka troublesome.\n",
