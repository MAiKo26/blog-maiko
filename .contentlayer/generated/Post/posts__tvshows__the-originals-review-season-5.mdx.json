The season blends emotional farewells with intense supernatural conflicts, leaving a lasting impact on viewers.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### Time Jump and New Challenges\n\nThe season begins with a significant time jump, showcasing the aftermath of the events from Season 4. The Mikaelsons are forced to confront the repercussions of their actions and the new threats that arise in their absence.\n\n### Key Characters\n\n- **Klaus Mikaelson**: Klaus remains a central figure, navigating his complicated relationship with Hope and the responsibilities of being a father. His character development reaches new heights as he faces both external dangers and his internal struggles.\n- **Elijah Mikaelson**: Elijah's loyalty and dedication to his family are put to the test, showcasing his growth and commitment to protecting those he loves.\n- **Hope Mikaelson**: Hope's journey takes center stage as she grapples with her identity and the legacy of her family. Her character development is a highlight of the season.\n- **Hayley Marshall**: Hayley's fierce protectiveness toward Hope remains a driving force in the narrative, showcasing her strength as a mother and leader.\n- **Freya Mikaelson**: Freya's role expands as she navigates her own challenges and supports her family in the face of new threats.\n\n### Central Conflicts\n\n1. **Klaus and Hope's Relationship**: The father-daughter dynamic is explored deeply, emphasizing the complexities of their relationship as they confront external challenges and their family's legacy.\n\n2. **Emergence of New Threats**: As the Mikaelsons face new adversaries, the season highlights the importance of unity and family bonds in overcoming obstacles.\n\n3. **Elijah's Struggles**: Elijah's internal conflicts and his desire to protect his family lead to significant character development, culminating in crucial moments of sacrifice and growth.\n\n### Key Moments\n\n- **The Return of Familiar Faces**: The season brings back beloved characters, deepening the emotional stakes and allowing for nostalgic moments that resonate with long-time fans.\n- **Hope's Growth**: Hope's journey toward embracing her identity as a Mikaelson adds depth to the season, showcasing her evolution and the weight of her family's legacy.\n- **Emotional Farewells**: As the season progresses, the emotional farewells of key characters create a poignant atmosphere, highlighting the themes of love, sacrifice, and the enduring bond of family.\n\n## Overall Impression\n\nSeason 5 of _The Originals_ successfully concludes the story of the Mikaelson family, blending intense conflicts with heartfelt moments. The character development, particularly for Klaus and Hope, creates an emotional resonance that makes this season memorable.\n\n### Rating\n\n**Rating: 16/20**\n\nThe combination of thrilling supernatural elements and emotional depth makes Season 5 a fitting conclusion to the series, while still leaving a lasting impression on the audience.\n\n## Thoughts on _Legacies_\n\nAs a spin-off, _Legacies_ has been a significant disappointment. It strays from the darker, more complex tone of _The Vampire Diaries_ and _The Originals_, opting for a lighthearted, humorous approach that feels out of place within the established universe.\n\nThe characters of Hope and Alaric deserved a show that respected the legacy of their predecessors rather than one that diluted the intensity and emotional weight that fans loved. The humorous tone undermines the serious themes explored in the original series, making it feel like a completely different world.\n\nAfter dropping _Legacies_ after Season 1, I can confidently say that it failed to capture the essence of what made _The Originals_ and _TVD_ so compelling. Even the much-anticipated return of Kai fell flat, lacking the gravitas and charm that his character embodied in the earlier series. Overall, _Legacies_ feels like a wasted opportunity that detracted from one of my favorite universes of all time.\n",
