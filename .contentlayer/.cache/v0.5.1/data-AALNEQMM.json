This group is quite iconic in all anime and each had a pretty decent role at the start.\n\nIt's a hot take these days but Sakura got too much hate, at least in Part 1 rewatching it Sakura is a decent character. Meanwhile, I am not a fan of Sasuke to get things started, never been a fan of this arctype of character but to be honest looking at recent evolution of sasukes in new gen anime he is still leagues above what came after him.\n\nAs for Kakashi, he was decent. I know he is pretty popular but I never got the appeal. The mysterious persona got stale after time for me.\n\nNaruto on the other hand was absolutely and with no doubt the best of the group not just because of him being the main character or anything but also he felt to have the most agency and the best dialogue in my opinion, he stands out in team 7.\n\nOverall the dynamic of this team is like I said earlier iconic and inspired many and many new gen anime to copy it (ehm jjk).\n\n### The other teams\n\nIf I had to pick today who was my favorite teams aside from 7, it was easily Team 3, 10 and 8.\n\nTeam 3 because of Kiba, I think one of the most hilarious things looking back at it is Kiba saying he will be Hokage challenging Naruto. His powers were quite unique and pretty fun.\n\nTeam 10 has my GOAT, Shikamaru who has 2 of the 5 best fights in the story and overall just a great character and the most relatable one in animanga.\n\nTeam 3 or more commonly Team Guy, just simply the best group. The group with the most interesting storyline even more than Team 7 for me, except for the female of the group which fade in irrelevance. Guy, Rock Lee and Neji Hyuga are simply some of the greatest characters in animanga.\n\n## The Plot\n\n### The First Arc\n\nThe early arcs in _Naruto_ introduce us to the ninja world and let's be honest it is the most interesting concept as well ... Everyone as a kid wanted to be a Ninja not a Samurai or a Pirate.\n\nAlso I'm glad my first _real_ introduction into anime/manga came into a very rich world building not another japan/usa centered world ... I just think if you're gonna do a fantasy story don't do it in real world earth; make your own world.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/a/a2/Naruto_Hiding.png)\n</div>\n\nFirst with the Land of Waves arc being the standout starter. We explore all the hardships Naruto had to go through as an outcast, back then that was a pretty unique story and pretty engaging.\n\n### Chunin Exam (One of the Shonen Arcs of All Times)\n\nChunin Exam considered by many one of the greatest Shonen Arcs of all times and it only comes 35 chapters (20 episodes) in the story which helped imo Naruto a lot in the western audience who aren't as patience and just want to get to the meat as soon as possible (One Piece's biggest problem but these days they got past it) and [appearantly even Kishimoto was going the Oda route of Slow Pace but he got forced into creating this masterpiece](https://www.cbr.com/naruto-editors-forced-creator-write-chunin-exams-arc/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=Echobox-AMF&utm_medium=Social-Distribution&utm_source=Facebook&mibextid=Zxz2cZ#Echobox=1689603047).\n\nI can go on and on about how brilliant Chunin Exam but let's start from the beginning and Gaara is here. The arc starts with Naruto meeting Gaara and learning about the Chunin Exam with each nation sending their best genin trying to become Chunin and Konoha kind assembled the avengers 9 for this.\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/naruto-konoha-12-at-the-chunin-exams.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Chunin Exam Konoha's 9\"\n  className=\"w-full object-cover\"\n/>\n\nFrom the beginning everyone was waiting for Sasuke vs Gaara, the 2 prodigee and still to this day sad we didn't get the full conclusion of that (I think Sasuke would've won btw). Shikamaru's role here was dope too although back then I didn't really understand the plot around him, I just thought he is a fodder villain that will be defeated soon but I was wrong.\n\nAside from Sasuke/Shikamaru plotline, the main interesting thing is the Hyuga story that Naruto got into and it's for sure what elevated not just the arc but Part 1 as a whole, sad it was dropped later tho.\n\n### Naruto vs Sasuke and End of Part 1\n\n![](https://theanimescrolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Naruto-Vs-Sasuke-Final-Battle-Naruto.jpg)\n\nThe unfinished duel and the chase was exciting at least at this point of the story for me it was and I was even more excited to get to the _cool part_ where everyone grows and get stronger and have flashier abilities that I was promised ... little did I know I will miss the first part so much.\n\n## My Favorite Moments\n\n### Neji vs Naruto/Hinata\n\nNeji's fight with Naruto, as well as his clash with Hinata, are two of the most impactful battles in the series. They dive deep into the struggles of the Hyuga family, but more than that, they showcase Naruto's determination to break through any limit, that's what I originally thought, sadly part 2 had different plans for Neji, the greatest tragedy of Naruto's writing.\n\n### Lee vs Gaara\n\nLee's fight against Gaara is one of those unforgettable moments where every emotion is amplified. Seeing Lee open the Eight Gates to give everything he has was nothing short of legendary, and it shows his warrior spirit in the face of impossible odds.\n\nAnd ofc the iconic weights drop, no one will forget that.\n\n### Shikamaru\n\nI want to be a cloud too, it's the only fight I rewatch or have saved on my youtube. He is my favorite character without a doubt.\n\n## Rating\n\nSimply put, the first part of _Naruto_ is greatness in its purest form. From the world-building and character arcs to the memorable battles, it set a high standard for what shonen anime could achieve. It's a series I'll always look back on fondly.\n\n**Rating: 18/20**\n",

          "raw": "\n![Next.js pass](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-1.webp)\n\n# What's new ?\n\nOn 24th Octobre we had Next.js conf24 an amazing event where the Vercel team shared the newest and latest updates about Next.js and its future trajectory.\n\nIn the conference there were some big updates followed by other small remarkable features, and the Keynotes started by unveiling 4 main goals they had for Next.js 15:\n\n- Make it Work\n\n- Make it Right\n\n- Make it Fast\n\n- Ship it\n\n## Make it Work :\n\nSo much complexity comes bundled in Next.js and React ecosystem as a whole and Server components came to simplify all of that Dynamic APIs (headers, cookies, searchParams...) and Route config options (revalidate, fetchCache...) and all the data fetching complexity.\n\n![Flight Code Demonstration](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-2.webp)\n\nSo Next.js 15 focused on simplifying data fetching and make it work like you expect with no magic or over caching.\n\n## Make it Right :\n\nTo make it right, you have to iterate over and over again to go from an idea to ship.\n\n![Idea to Ship](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-3.webp)\n\nAnd this is where _Turbopack_ came into prominence not just for speed but also for reliability and DX friendliness.\n\nIn the past Next.js had implicit errors but now it does an accurate diff and it tells you where you made an error especially for Hydration errors where I'm sure a lot of people have faced before.\n\nAnd now the Vercel team has officially announced that Turbopack is stable for dev server with parity with exiting compiler while expanding ecosystem compatibility and optimized cold compilation.\n\nWith the new Turbopack compiler it's 50% faster for initial compilation and up to 90% faster for code updates with fast refresh which's an insane improvement compared to the old compiler and they even tested it live on the Next.js website itself where it showed remarkable difference in speed.\n\nTurbopack is now finally Developement Stable but it's still not Build Stable as [you can still check the progress on AreWeTurboYet?](https://areweturboyet.com/) where it's 96% tests passing but those last 4% are the hardest to achieve so it will be a while before we hear another update about it.\n\n## Make it Fast:\n\nTurbopack was already a marvelous reveal for making it fast but this section was also really good as it was all about caching.\n\n\"use cache\" it's the latest and newest directive introduced by Next.js where it's by default it uses in process memory cache where it starts at memory but you can later configure it to any architecture you want.\n\nSimilar to \"use server\" and \"use client\", caching is now an opt-in experience unlike previously with Next.js.\n\nunstable_cache is now pretty much deprecated as \"use cache\" is considered it's successor.\n\nAlso for revalidation cacheTag and cacheLife are APIs introduced to give you more control on caching while getting rid of other deprecated methods like `fetch(\"\", { cache: \"no-store\"})` , `\"force-dynamic\"` , `\"force-cache\"` , `export const revalidate` etc... which weren't as intuitive to use.\n\n![use cache Code Demonstration](/images/content/tech/nextjs-conf24-what-is-new-in-nextjs-15-4.webp)\n\nShip it\nSelf-Hosting has been a huge issue for Next.js as it seemed hosting Next outside of Vercel felt impossible and it even sparked an entire Open Source Community dedicated to making Next.js truly Open Source and hostable anywhere called OpenNext and here the Vercel team renewed their commitement to making Next.js truly easy to host anywhere not just on Vercel.\n\nFirst they started by explaining that the docs lacked depth as it didn't explain all the key features of Next.js behind the scenes like Rendering, Caching/ISR and Image optimization that Vercel did for you behind the scenes and their first commitment is for Self-Hosting Education and to improve the docs overall.\n\nSecond, as mentioned in the previous section they made caching more customizable and easier to do so when deploying in Docker Containers you know how to adjust everything according to your needs.\n\nThird, Sharp Installation is now Automatic bundled with Next.js instead of their native WebAssembly for Image optimization because the latter used too much memory which would be a problem on a VPS.\n\nAnd finally Node.js middleware is now supported by Next.js and Vercel has partnered with many known self-hosting services to create adapters and docs under a [new Github organization Next.js](https://github.com/orgs/nextjs/repositories).\n",

          "raw": "\n# The Vampire Diaries Season 1 Review\n\n## Opening Thoughts\n\n### How I got to watch TVD\n\nBack in Middle School around 2011, my cousin introduced me to my very first TV Show. He was older than me by 4 years so He was always the one to introduce me to a lot of things and this time around he described me this epic fantasy of vampire and werewolves so I was totally into it.\n\nBack then I watched Season 1 in French as I barely understood english (nor did I understand much french but it was better as we learn French before English for some reason in our Education system) but then I rewatched the show couple of times in English later down the years when I learned the language and the voices totally freaked me out :sob:\n\n### The living in the shadow mystery\n\nThis trope completely hooked me and with later shows that I will review this stays as my absolute favorite one to watch, having the double identity and trying to juggle between and balance them was always a really cool one and here comes Stephen Salvatore, a recent transfered high schooler to Mystic Falls with everything looking normal at first for us to later discover he is a vampire.\n\n### The Evil Brother\n\nThe show was already very interesting from the get go, but it went from great to amazing after the introduction of Damon Salvatore. He was simply a showstopper, the savagery and the overall badass attitude was top notch. Al though for season 1 Damon was portrayed way more vilanous than I even remember him to be, He was kinda wild tbh especially what he did to Caroline and that whole B plotline.\n\n### The love Triangle\n\nI wasn't as big of a fan of the love stories when I first started, I was much more looking into supernatural vampires going wild, my mind changes as the seasons evolve but still not my main interest when I started TVD.\n\n![](/images/content/tvshows/the-vampire-diaries-review-season-1.webp)\n\n# The Plot of Season 1\n\n## First half\n\nSeason 1 was basically about Stephen vs Damon and them chasing after Katherine a mysterious figure from their past that resembled Elena. We start with Elena Gilbert who had her parents pass away last year in a trajic car accident and where Elena magically survived. We also meet various prominent characters that I will talk about later.\n\nThe season progressed where Elena slowly unveil the lies around her and discover what's happening. I think one of my favorite moments early on is when Stephan offered vervain(?) neckless to Elena that would stop Damon's manipulation and that resulted in him getting slapped for asking for a kiss.\n\nAnother plotline that ran alongside the main one was the Gilbert watch with the sheriff and the maire(?) of the town and that would have the crescendo of this season.\n\n## Second half\n\nThings ramp up in the second half of the season when Vicki died after Stephen turned her into a vampire and her unable to control herself which also led Jeremy to a depression arc that I wasn't a fan of ... Later on we finally discover what Damon has been trying to do when he returned to Mystic Falls and it's not to mess with Stephen and Elena but instead it was to free Katherine, the original love for the brothers.\n\nAnd here comes the fun, 25 vampires are on the loose and the big twist is that **Katherine was never there** to begin with and it's revealed that their whole relationship is a lie really.\n\nFirst Katherine aside, the most interesting plot during this stretch for me atleast is Jeremy's relationship with Anna. I don't care what anyone says but Jer and Anna were the perfect couple back then and it's really shame she died and goes without a saying I wanted him to turn into a Vampire would've been really cool.\n\n## Finale : Werewolf reveal\n\nI was waiting for it the whole season anyway, where are the werewolfs my cousin promised. It's supposed to be Vampires vs Werewolves and here we are it's the Lockwood family.\n\nDuring the finale the device that disrubted supernatural figures (but not witches i think ?) was kinda interesting and delievered on it's promise and hype while the season ends with the reveal it also ends with Jeremy trying to turn into a Vampire which I also wanted really bad.\n\n# Character Notes\n\nPretty much these are my thoughts of the main characters during Season 1 :\n\n- Stephan Salvatore : All things considered Stephan was the star of the show and my favorite thing of Season 1 from his hidden mysteries to his dark past and the whole plot of his uncontrollable state when he drinks blood was really entertaining and kept a variant of surprise.\n\n- Elena Gilbert : She was okay, I never been an Elena enjoyer. She had numerous great scenes with Damon being the freak of nature that he represented this season.\n\n- Damon Salvatore : Absolute freak, with later season knowledge I even forgot how wild Damon was in early seasons and for sure my second favorite character of the season.\n\n- Jeremy Gilbert : Really Entertaining, even tho I said I'm not interested in romantic relationships and just wanted supernatural chaos but his with Vicki then with Anna were really good this season and overall a solid character.\n\n- Bonnie Bennett : Spoiler alert, my overall favorite character of the show but She was sidelined in the first season as the show hasn't explored the Witch side of supernaturals.\n\n- Caroline Forbes : Lol, just felt bad for her for most of the season but nothing else.\n\n- Alaric Saltzman : Great story, sympathatic and all. He was a great addition in the second half and went on to be one of the best characters in the franchise.\n\n# Rating\n\nThe mix of romance, supernatural action, and drama works well, creating an addictive season 1. The characters were really amazing overall but the plot kinda stalled and tbh that stalling is kind of the charm of early seasons.\n\n**Rating : 14/20**\n",
